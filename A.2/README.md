How do compile:
Use "make all" to compile everything.
Use "make server" to run the server.
Use "make client" to run the client.

You can change the IP and PORT on the Makefile on the root folder. Changing the following lines:
export IP_SERVER := 127.0.0.1
export PORT_SERVER := 5054
It's just a simple calculator.
